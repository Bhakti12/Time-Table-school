Remember : Small details make your future brighter

main file is time-table.js

but if you want to see small details about working or any topic you can see : 
example.js
structure.js

I believe that program build on your fundamentals and small topics and concepts you learn

so I learn so far from this is to use : 
const,var,let
arrays and its functions,
array of objects,
structure the objects and nested objects,
dates (using date-fns library). you can see it : https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started,
many more also .. 
but working on that so update it soon....

chill so much details ...
